He works as a dedicated fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a popular fast-food joint, and his childlike wonder often leads him into hilarious and adventurous situations with his friends.

- Jellyfishing expertise: He's an avid jellyfish enthusiast and skilled at catching jellyfish with his trusty net.
- Karate prowess: SpongeBob holds a black belt in karate under the tutelage of Sandy Cheeks, and his unique style of "Karate Chops" can be surprisingly effective in a fight.
